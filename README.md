# ProjectR

Developed with Unreal Engine 5

# Development Environment Setup

1. Clone this repo
1. Open project in UE5.
1. The following content is large and unmodified from source, so it's Git ignored. Add it to the project manually:
    1. Third Person Content Pack: Content Drawer > Add > Add Feature or Content Pack > Blueprint > Third Person > Add to project. Note only the Content/Characters folder is ignored from this Content Pack, but adding it will still work correctly.
